title: About this book
---
## This book covers the ClojureScript programming language, serves as a
detailed guide of its tooling for development, and presents a series of
articles about topics that are applicable to day-to-day programming in
ClojureScript.

It is not an introductory book to programming in that it assumes the
reader has experience programming in at least one language. However, it
doesn’t assume experience with *Clojure* or functional programming.
We’ll try to include links to reference material when talking about
the theoretical underpinnings of ClojureScript that may not be familiar
to everyone.

Since the ClojureScript documentation is good but sparse, we wanted to
write a compendium of reference information and extensive examples to
serve as a ClojureScript primer as well as a series of practical
how-to’s. This document will evolve with the ClojureScript language,
both as a reference of the language features and as a sort of cookbook
with practical programming recipes.

You’ll get the most out of this book if you:

  - are curious about ClojureScript or functional programming and have
    some programming experience;

  - write JavaScript or any other language that compiles to it and want
    to know what ClojureScript has to offer;

  - already know some Clojure and want to learn how ClojureScript
    differs from it, plus practical topics like how to target both
    languages with the same code base.

Don’t be turned off if you don’t see yourself in any of the above
groups. We encourage you to give this book a try and to give us feedback
on how we can make it more accessible. Our goal is to make ClojureScript
more friendly to newcomers and spread the ideas about programming that
Clojure has helped popularize, as we see a lot of value in them.
