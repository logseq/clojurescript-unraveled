*ClojureScript* is an implementation of the Clojure programming language
that targets JavaScript. Because of this, it can run in many different
execution environments including web browsers, Node.js, io.js and
Nashorn.

Unlike other languages that intend to *compile* to JavaScript (like
TypeScript, FunScript, or CoffeeScript), ClojureScript is designed to
use JavaScript like bytecode. It embraces functional programming and has
very safe and consistent defaults. Its semantics differ significantly
from those of JavaScript.

Another big difference (and in our opinion an advantage) over other
languages is that Clojure is designed to be a guest. It is a language
without its own virtual machine that can be easily adapted to the
nuances of its execution environment. This has the benefit that Clojure
(and hence ClojureScript) has access to all the existing libraries
written for the host language.

Before we jump in, let us summarize some of the core ideas that
ClojureScript brings to the table. Don’t worry if you don’t understand
all of them right now, they’ll become clear throughout the book.

  - ClojureScript enforces the functional programming paradigm with its
    design decisions and idioms. Although being strongly opinionated
    about functional programming it’s a pragmatic language rather than
    pursuing theoretical purity.

  - Encourages programming with immutable data, offering highly
    performant and state of the art immutable collection
    implementations.

  - It makes a clear distinction of identity and its state, with
    explicit constructs for managing change as a series of immutable
    values over time.

  - It has type-based and value-based polymorphism, elegantly solving
    the expression problem.

  - It is a Lisp dialect so programs are written in the programming
    language’s own data structures, a property known as *homoiconicity*
    that makes metaprogramming (programs that write programs) as simple
    as it can be.

These ideas together have a great influence in the way you design and
implement software, even if you are not using ClojureScript. Functional
programming, decoupling of data (which is immutable) from the operations
to transform it, explicit idioms for managing change over time and
polymorphic constructs for programming to abstractions greatly simplify
the systems we write.

We hope you enjoy the book and ClojureScript brings the same joy and
inspiration that has brought to us.
